# Motivation

A quick .hi-blue[quiz]:


Select the statement (*a*, *b*, or *c*) that you agree with most strongly. .hi[There are no wrong answers here!]

&lt;br&gt;

How do you interpret the following: "*When flipping a coin, the probability of flipping Heads is 0.5*"?

&lt;br&gt;

  - (*a*) If I flip this coin over and over and over and over, roughly 50% of the flips will be Heads.
  - (*b*) If I flip this coin, Heads / Tails are equally plausible.
  - (*c*) Both of the above make sense.

&lt;br&gt;

An election is coming up and a pollster claims that "*candidate A has a 0.9 probability of winning.*" How do you interpret this probability?

&lt;br&gt;

  - (*a*) If we observe the election over and over, candidate A will win roughly 90% of the time.
  - (*b*) Candidate A is much more likely to win than to lose.
  - (*c*) The pollster’s calculation is wrong. Candidate A will either win or lose, thus their probability of winning can only be 0 or 1.

A quick .hi-blue[quiz]:


Select the statement (*a* or *b*) that you agree with most strongly. .hi[There are no wrong answers here!]

--

In a survey with 10 students, they are asked the following 2 questions:

  - Will you vote for a Republican in 2024? 10 out of 10 say "yes."
  - Each student is given a sample of Pepsi and Coke. 10 out of 10 correctly identify which is which.

&lt;br&gt;

In light of these experiments, what do you conclude?

  - (*a*) You’re more confident that students can distinguish between Coke and Pepsi than that students plan to vote for a Republican candidate.
  - (*b*) he evidence in favor of students’ intention to vote a Republican is just as strong as the evidence in favor of  students’ ability to distinguish between Coke and Pepsi.

# Motivation

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

If your answers were (*a*), (*a*), and (*b*), you are fairly .hi[frequentist].

--

If your answers were (*b*), (*b*), and (*a*), you are a .hi-blue[Bayesian].

--

If your answers to the first two questions were (*c*) and (*c*), you have .hi-orange[no side!]

# Studying probability

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

You have probably either used or heard the words *luck*, *coincidence*, *odds*, *chance* in your life to reflect some .hi[guess] or .hi-blue[prediction] about future events.

--

These can also be understood as .hi[probability statements].

--

  - Perhaps you don't usually .hi-green[quantify] these guesses!


--

Whether you translate such predictions into numbers or not, in the next lectures we will study probability as a .hi-blue[logical path] to measure *uncertainty* and *randomness* through *theoretical principles*.

---

# Studying probability

Probability is the .hi[logic of uncertainty]. 

--

It quantifies uncertainty in a way through which we may 

  - formalize such uncertainty;
  
  - make informed decisions about uncertain events;
  
  - make inferences about noisy processes and population parameters;
  
  - better understand our surroundings.

# Basics of set theory

# Basics of set theory

The mathematical framework for probability is built around .hi[sets].

--

Suppose we run an .red[*experiment*], and its result is one out of a set of possible .red[*outcomes*] (.red[*events*]).

--

Before one can quantify the inherent *randomness* in this experiment, one must understand its possible outcomes.

--

Consider some definitions:

  - A .hi-slate[sample space] (*S*) is the collection of all possible outcomes of an experiment;
  
  - An .hi-slate[event] is an element or collection of elements in the sample space, typically denoted by capital letters (e.g., *A, B, C*).
  
    - Thus an event is a *subset* of the sample space *S*: *A* &amp;#8838; *S*.
    
---

# Basics of set theory



Some .hi-blue[special events]:


- Empty (null) set (&amp;#8709;): contains .hi[no] outcomes.

--

- The complement of an event (*A*&lt;sup&gt;*C*&lt;/sup&gt;): contains .hi-slate[all] outcomes that are not in event *A*.

--

- Intersection between events (*A* &amp;#8745; *B*): contains all outcomes that are in .hi[both] *A* and *B*.

  - *A* and *B* are .hi-blue[disjoint] if *A* &amp;#8745; *B* = &amp;#8709;.
  
--
  
- Union between events (*A* &amp;#8746; *B*): contains all outcomes that are in *A* .hi-slate[or] *B* .hi-slate[or] both.

--

- De Morgan's laws: 
  
  - (*A* &amp;#8746; *B*)&lt;sup&gt;*C*&lt;/sup&gt; = *A*&lt;sup&gt;*C*&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;#8745; *B*&lt;sup&gt;*C*&lt;/sup&gt;
  - (*A* &amp;#8745; *B*)&lt;sup&gt;*C*&lt;/sup&gt; = *A*&lt;sup&gt;*C*&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;#8746; *B*&lt;sup&gt;*C*&lt;/sup&gt;

# Many shades of probability

# Many shades of probability

Now it is time to study the .hi[uncertainty] associated with the possible outcomes of an experiment.

--

To this purpose, we will need .hi-blue[probability].

--

Informally, one may define probability as *a measure of uncertainty, ranging between 0 (impossible outcome) and 1 (almost certain event).*

--

&lt;br&gt;

But there are more .hi-slate[formal] ways of defining it:

  - The "*naive*" definition of probability;
  
  - The "*frequency*" definition of probability;
  
  - The "*Bayesian*" definition of probability.


---

# Many shades of probability

The .hi[earliest] definition of the probability of an event was to .hi-slate[count] the number of *ways* the event could happen and divide by the *total* number of possible outcomes for the experiment.

$$
`\begin{aligned}
P^{naive}(A) = \dfrac{\text{number of ways A can happen}}{\text{total number of outcomes in} \ S}
\end{aligned}`
$$

--

&lt;br&gt;

The naive definition is very .hi[restrictive]. 

  - It requires *S* to be *finite*, with equal symmetry across events/outcomes.
  
  - Events must be *equally likely*!
  
---

# Many shades of probability

Given the .hi-blue[limitations] of the naive definition of probability, we will move on to more general and effective concepts.


&gt; A *probability space* consists of a sample space *S* and a *probability function* *P* which takes an event *A* &amp;#8838; *S* as input and returns *P(A)*, a real number between 0 and 1, as output.

--

The function *P(&amp;middot;)* must satisfy the following .hi[two] axioms:

  - *P*(&amp;#8709;) = 0;
  - *P(S)* = 1
  
--

If events *A*&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, *A*&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, *A*&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,... are .hi-blue[disjoint], then

$$
`\begin{aligned}
P \bigg(\bigcup_{j=1}^{\infty} A_j \bigg) = \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} P(A_j)
\end{aligned}`
$$

---

# Many shades of probability


Any function *P(&amp;middot;)* that satisfies the two axioms is considered a .hi[valid] probability function.

--

However, the axioms don’t tell us how probability should be .hi-blue[interpreted].

--

There are different .hi-slate[schools of thought] regarding such interpretation.

--

&lt;br&gt;

The .hi[frequentist] view of probability is that it represents a long-run frequency over a large number of repetitions of an experiment: if we say a coin has probability 1/2 of Heads, that means the coin would land Heads 50% of the time if we tossed it over and over and over.

--

The .hi-slate[Bayesian] view of probability is that it represents a degree of belief about the event in question, so we can assign probabilities to hypotheses like “candidate A will win the election” or “the defendant is guilty” even if it is not possible to repeat the same election or the same crime over and over again.
